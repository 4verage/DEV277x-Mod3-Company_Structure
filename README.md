# DEV277x-Mod3-Company_Structure
Classwork for the Company Structure project near the end of the DEV277x OOP in Java Microsoft class.

NOTES: There are always 0 checkins. There is no code to change, alter, or request checkins, but the methods are there to operate them. The same thing goes for bonus requests. I believe all of this works, but the test code doesn't do much penetration testing.

Hopefully I was able to successfully fulfill the goals of this project outline.
